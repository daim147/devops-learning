## Introduction

Bash is a powerful Unix shell and command language. It serves as an interactive shell and a scripting language to automate tasks and system operations.

## Getting Started

Create a new Bash script file with a `.sh` extension and make it executable:

```bash
# Create and open a script file
vim myscript.sh

# Make it executable using chmod to give the user permission to execute the script
chmod +x myscript.sh

# Add the shebang at the top it makes the script executable /bin/bash is the path to the bash interpreter that will be used to run the script and #! is the shebang character sequence that tells the system that the file is a script and should be interpreted by the specified program
echo "#!/bin/bash" > myscript.sh
```

## Variables

Variables store data values. Quote variables to avoid unexpected word splitting.

```bash
# Define variables
name="Alice"
age=30

# Use variables
echo "Name: $name, Age: $age"
```

### Command-Line Arguments

Access command-line arguments passed to the script.

```bash
# Access command-line arguments
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
```

Pass arguments when running the script:

```bash
./myscript.sh arg1 arg2
```

### Environment Variables

Access environment variables available to the script.

```bash
# Access environment variables
echo "Home directory: $HOME" # User's home directory
echo "User: $USER" # Current user
echo "Path: $PATH" # Colon-separated list of directories to search for commands
```

You can also set custom environment variables:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export MY_VAR="Hello, World"
echo "Custom variable: $MY_VAR"
```

Remove environment variables:

```bash
# Remove environment variables
unset MY_VAR
```

More environment variables are available on your system. Use `printenv` to list all environment variables.

```bash
printenv
```

### Special Variables

Special variables provide additional information about the script and its execution.

- `$0`: Script name
- `$1`, `$2`, ...: Command-line arguments
- `$#`: Number of command-line arguments
- `$@`: All command-line arguments
- `$?`: Exit status of the last command
- `$$`: Process ID of the script
- `$USER`: Current user
- `$HOME`: User's home directory
- `$PWD`: Current working directory

More special variables are available. [Learn more](./shell_special_variable.md).

[Shell Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Variables.html). [Shell Parameters](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameters.html). [Special Parameters](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Special-Parameters.html).

## Control Structures

### Conditional Statements

Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute commands based on conditions.

```bash
if [ "$name" == "Alice" ]; then
    echo "Hello, Alice!"
elif [ "$name" == "Bob" ]; then
    echo "Hi, Bob!"
else
    echo "Greetings!"
fi
```

### Loops

#### For Loop

Iterate over a sequence or list.

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Iteration: $i"
done
```

#### While Loop

Repeat commands while a condition is true.

```bash
count=0
while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

## Functions

Functions modularize your code and help with code reuse.

```bash
function greet {
    local person=$1
    echo "Hello, $person!"
}

# Call the function
greet "Alice"
```

## Arrays

Arrays hold multiple values and enhance data management.

```bash
# Declare an array
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")

# Iterate over the array
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
    echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done
```

## Arithmetic and Command Substitution

Perform arithmetic and capture command output.

```bash
# Arithmetic expression
result=$((5 + 3))
echo "Result: $result"

# Command substitution
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today's date: $current_date"
```

## Best Practices

- Always quote your variables.
- Start scripts with a shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
- Use `set -e` to exit immediately on errors.
- Comment your code for clarity.
- Use tools like ShellCheck to lint your scripts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on errors

# Your script logic goes here...
```

## Conclusion

This guide covered the foundations of Bash scriptingâ€”from variables and control structures to functions, arrays, arithmetic, and best practices. With these essentials, you can create scripts to automate tasks and manage systems efficiently.

Happy scripting!
