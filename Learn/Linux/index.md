# Linux

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

## History

Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers.

## Distributions

Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server use. Some popular mainstream Linux distributions include Debian (and its derivatives such as Ubuntu), Fedora and openSUSE. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting utilities and libraries and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution's intended use.

## Linux vs Unix

Linux is a Unix-like operating system, and there are other Unix-like operating systems out there. Unix is a family of operating systems, which includes Linux, Solaris, and BSD. Linux is a Unix-like operating system, but was developed without any Unix code, unlike BSD and its variants.

## Debian vs Fedora

Debian and Fedora are two of the most popular Linux distributions. Debian is known for its stability and is used as a base for many other distributions, while Fedora is known for its bleeding edge software and is the basis for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Difference between Flavor and Distribution

A Linux distribution is a flavor of Linux, but a flavor of Linux is not necessarily a distribution. A flavor of Linux is a particular distribution of Linux that has been customized for a particular purpose or set of users.

## Difference between Package Manager in Debian, Fedora and RPM

Debian uses the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) to manage packages, Fedora uses the Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM) and RPM Package Manager (RPM) to manage packages. RPM is also used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS.

Main difference between APT and YUM is that APT is a single package manager, while YUM is a package manager and a package repository manager.

## Difference between Package Manager and Package Repository Manager

A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages. A package repository manager is a tool that manages software packages in a repository, which is a collection of software packages. Like _Npm_ is a package manager and _Npm registry_ is a package repository manager.
