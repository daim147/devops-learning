# General Information

`[vagrant@localhost ~]$` is the default command prompt for a Vagrant virtual machine. It consists of the username `vagrant` and the hostname `localhost`. The hostname `localhost` is used to refer to the local system, while the username `vagrant` is the default username for a Vagrant virtual machine. The `~` symbol represents the current user's home directory. The `$` symbol indicates that the user has normal user privileges. If the user has root privileges, the command prompt will end with a `#` symbol.
