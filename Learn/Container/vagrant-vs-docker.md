# Vagrant vs Docker: Key Differences

## Architecture

- **Vagrant**: Creates and manages full virtual machines with complete OS
- **Docker**: Creates containers that share the host OS kernel

## Resource Usage

- **Vagrant**: Requires more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) as it runs full VMs
- **Docker**: Lightweight, uses fewer resources due to container architecture

## Boot Time

- **Vagrant**: Slower boot times (30+ seconds) as it needs to start entire VM
- **Docker**: Near-instant startup (seconds) as containers are lightweight

## Isolation

- **Vagrant**: Complete isolation with full OS virtualization
- **Docker**: Process-level isolation, shares host kernel

## Use Cases

- **Vagrant**:
  - Development environments requiring full OS
  - Testing across different OS environments
  - Legacy application development
- **Docker**:
  - Microservices architecture
  - Application packaging and deployment
  - CI/CD pipelines

## Configuration

- **Vagrant**: Uses Vagrantfile for VM configuration
- **Docker**: Uses Dockerfile for container configuration

## Portability

- **Vagrant**: Portable across hypervisors
- **Docker**: Highly portable across any system running Docker engine

## Development Workflow

- **Vagrant**: Better for full-stack development environments
- **Docker**: Better for application containerization and deployment
